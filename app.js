//I want to see a message in the console
//In the console, perform the log action with the following message
console.log("Test");

//I want to store some data
//we are going to use variables to store data
//we can use two keywords to write variables: let, const
//we only use the keyword to declare a variable --> we only use it when the box is new
//we can only store ONE value in a variable
const myName = "Palesa";
let myLocation = "Leicester";
let myJob = "Learner";

//I want to see my variable in the console
console.log(myName);

//I want to store another piece of data in the same box
//I don't declare the variable again because the variable already exists; we only declare them once.
myName = "Joe";

console.log(myName);

//if we declare a variable with const, we CANNOT change the value inside; it's constant
